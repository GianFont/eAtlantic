#The local controller will collect
#real-time data such as buffer capacity, configured MAC layer protocol, energy, hop
#count, CPU usage from IoT devices using OpenFlow, OF-Config, OVS-DB protocol, and
#NETCONF. This data will then be forwarded to the global controller using the controller
#to controller communication protocols.
