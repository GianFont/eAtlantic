#This task is to apply a machine learning method to
#the data collected in Task 3.2 and select the best path for the controller to IoT device
#communication. Further, the best path is also selected from the controller to IoT device
#communication. We will employ deep Q-learning (DQL) to decide the optimal
#control-traffic path (from the controller to an IoT device) and the data-traffic path
#(from an IoT application node to the IoT device) subject to the reliability and latency
#requirements of the networks
